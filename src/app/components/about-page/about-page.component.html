          Raised in Florida, the sunshine state.
          <br>I now live in Ann Arbor, where I now go to school at the University of Michigan.
        </h2>
        <h2 class="mat-body-1">
          At the University of Michigan, I am encouraged to combine my academic interests and find career paths that allow me to express my curiosity.
          <br>Ultimately, this led me to change my initial thoughts on only pursuing a degree in Computer Science and to pursue a double major instead.
          <br>After discovering Cognitive Science with an emphasis in computation it felt like an ideal second major for me.
          <br>Through my Cognitive Science major, I embrace interdisciplinary study.
          I see the brain as nature's best computer, and how we can learn from the brain to develop intelligent computation.
          <br> Recently, I have become curious about applying machine learning methods that derive from human cognition to non-traditional use cases.
        </h2>
        <h2 class="mat-body-1">
          I have also been painting since I was five years old.
          <br>I enjoy painting objects with something off about them, an abnormal apple or a vase with implausible proportions.
          Itâ€™s intentional, viewers analyze my work longer.
          <br>My art has taught me how to be aware of perspective, and how to incorporate creativity and curiosity into my work.
