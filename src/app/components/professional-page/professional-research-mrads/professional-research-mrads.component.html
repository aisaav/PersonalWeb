      Background to Project
    </h3>
    <mat-card-subtitle mat-line>Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans)</mat-card-subtitle>
    <p mat-line>
      <span>
        A type of worm, commonly used in biological research.
        Their primitive nature allows for the study of essential biological characteristics and basic behavior.
        Some characterizations of movement/observed behavior in C. elegans include omega bends,
        reversal movement, forward movement and resting.

    <mat-card-subtitle mat-line>Bayesian Probabilities</mat-card-subtitle>
    <p mat-line>
    <span>
      Provides a way to formalize both prior knowledge and how update beliefs on the basis of new evidence
      (what is learned). Bayesian inference provides a computational basis for updating uncertain beliefs based on
      uncertain data. Bayes Rule helps us use given probabilities and reverse engineer missing information.
      Motivation to use Bayesian Analysis is from human cognition specifically normative reasoning.

      P(A|B) - the posterior probability, read as “the probability of A given B”
      <br>P(B|A) -  the likelihood, read as “the probability of B given A” or “the likelihood of observing B given A”
      <br>P(A) -  The Base rate, the probability of an event A
      <br>P(Ā) - probability of not A
      <br>Denominator usually referred to as normalizing term

    <mat-card-subtitle mat-line>Genetic algorithms and Motivation</mat-card-subtitle>
    <p mat-line>
      <span>
        A form of supervised machine learning, where the computer optimizes a solution through natural selection,
        this selection is usually done through a “fitness” algorithm.
        An optimal solution is produced through controlled natural selection, this approach is useful in exploring
        multiple possible outcomes.

    </p>
    <p mat-line>
      <span>
        For the purposes of this project, the “population” created comprised of the computers’ guesses for the states
        of a worm’s movement. This algorithm then “breeds” the guesses using a fitness algorithm that ranks the guesses
        using Bayesian inferencing and positional data, allowing the system to update the “population” accordingly.
        The goal was to create a system that can predict states of worm behavior with at least an 80% accuracy rate.
        If successful, the model can be adapted for more than three states and be used for other types of worm behavior.
        Furthermore, in creating a functional model using positional time series data would be a breakthrough in
        creating a system that analyzes worm behavior solely based on coordinates.
        The proposed method for this portion involves developing a genetic algorithm than uses Bayesian probabilities
        and a continuity measure to determine fitness. The idea being that with a good fitness function,
        genetic algorithms can perform with great accuracy.

      My Contribution
    </h3>
  </mat-list-item>
  <p mat-line>
    <span>
      Developed a program that used Genetic Algorithms to determine movement of a C. Elegans, a primitive worm species,
      using solely head, abdomen and tail positional data. Programmed automatic read, run, and write capabilities
      so new data could be used and analyzed quickly.
      Researched usage of Bayesian Calculations in Fitness Function of the algorithm and concluded through
      implementation and subsequent testing that this method was insufficient for our model to
      make accurate predictions. See Poster for more information.
