        Molecular dynamics is a computer simulation method for studying the movement of atoms in a particular medium.
        The benefit of using a molecular dynamic simulation is that it tracks different aspects of the atoms and can
        run for specific, controlled amounts of time. This allows for an accurate representation of how the atoms
        interact under specified conditions. Our project used Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator
        (LAMMPS) molecular dynamics program.

    <p mat-line>
      <span>
        The movement of particles from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration is known as
        diffusion. In determining the diffusivity of a medium, the movement of atoms under set conditions is analyzed.

        Fick‚Äôs law, shown below, states that the concentration gradient is directly proportional to the mass per unit
        time of an area and through this a diffusion constant can be derived.

    <mat-card-subtitle mat-line>Bootstrapping and Motivation</mat-card-subtitle>
    <p mat-line>
      <span>
        Bootstrapping is a statistical method reliant on computational calculations. Bootstrapping is the process of
        taking a randomized sample and developing new samples to calculate measures of accuracy such as confidence intervals.
        Bootstrapping takes a random sample of a predetermined size, treats this sample as a representative of the
        population it is trying to test. Once the original sample is taken, random elements from the original sample
        are chosen with replacement until the new sample becomes the predetermined size. Bootstrapping then continues to
        do this for N amount of times until it can quantify or produce some accuracy label for an estimate it makes.

      When measuring the error of a diffusion constant, multiple tests are required whether it be done in a simulation
      or in a laboratory. The time, cost and difficulty of performing multiple tests has prompted the search of an
      alternate method: bootstrapping. Since the trajectories of nearby atoms are correlated, sampling a group of
      atoms could be used to better describe all the atoms. Thus, using bootstrapping on different atom percentages
      could potentially solve the issue of running multiple simulations and produce desired results.
    </span>
    </p>
    <p mat-line>
    <span>
      Bootstrapping produces the best results when the original sample is random and independent:
      this causes an issue with testing atoms since their movements are correlated. Therefore, bootstrapping on a
      varying percentage and varying simulation time could determine how reliable this sampling method is in this context.

      My Contribution
    </h3>

      Developed a program that automated running of 200 simulations for each predetermined duration in LAMMPS and
      documented how atoms behaved in the simulator. I then averaged these samples to determine the 'true' diffusion
      coefficient for each duration. Using this output, I developed a second program dedicated to bootstrapping
      different sample sizes (12.5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) for the both durations. For each sample size, 200
      bootstraps were computed producing a diffusion coefficient and a margin of error to create a confidence interval
      for each bootstrap run. The third program I developed graphed the results and determined if the 'true' diffusion
      coefficient was within the confidence intervals the bootstrapping gave. The figure below shows a walkthrough of the
      overall process.

      Scattered results on duration and sample size prompt for additional research to fully determine effectiveness of
      bootstrapping for this purpose.

        Also wrote a formal research paper to submit to program managers and the professor I worked under. In the paper,
        I elaborated more about the research project as a whole and my contributions. See Paper for more information.
